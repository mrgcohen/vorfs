<div id = "rules">
	<h4>
	<p>1.  OWN any 5 GSWL Pro players nationwide each week.</p>
	<p>2.  You can only own a player for one week!</p>
	<p>3.  SCORE fantasy points based on their stats - hitting and pitching.</p>
	<p>4.  COMPETE for a trip to Vegas!  The owner with the most fantasy points at the end of the 2011 season wins flight/accommodation to watch the GSWL National Championship in Las Vegas.</p>
	<p>5.  Non-players are WELCOME and ENCOURAGED to participate!</p>

	<br>
	<p>The fine print: Only one team per person - and ONLY the team owner is eligible for Vegas - no transfers.  You may not own a player in fantasy if your GSWL team plays against that player that week.  Any other tampering with gameplay to benefit your fantasy team may result in disqualification.  Rules are subject to change before the season.</p>
